# Contrast_Streching
This program utilizes the OpenCV library to perform various image processing tasks, providing a foundation for understanding fundamental concepts in computer vision. The program begins by loading an image specified as a command-line argument and verifies its existence. It then converts the image to grayscale and creates a copy while preserving the original color information.

One notable feature is the computation and display of the image histogram, showcasing the distribution of pixel intensities. The program counts the occurrences of each intensity level and generates a histogram for visual analysis. This histogram is displayed alongside the original image, grayscale version and the copied image.
